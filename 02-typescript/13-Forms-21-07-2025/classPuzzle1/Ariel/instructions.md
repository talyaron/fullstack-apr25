# Project: Home Puzzle

Create a code design (look at the following image) like we did in class, but for the home puzzle project.

## Level 1 - max 85 points
create a simple game with a ball that moves around the screen when the user presses the arrow keys. The ball should explode (change image to explosion image) each time it is clicked by the mouse. After the explosion, the ball should disappear for 2 seconds and then reappear at a random position on the screen. 


## Level 2 - max 92 points
The same as level 1.
Add a gate to the game that the ball can pass through. The gate should be a rectangle that appears at a random position on the screen. When the ball passes through the gate, it should change its image to a different image (e.g., a star). A sound of cheers should be played. The gate should disappear after 5 seconds and reappear at a random position.


## Level 3 - max 100 points
create snake game with points.
