# Web Development Project - MVC Application (Client-Side TypeScript)

## Project Overview
Build a **client-side web application** using **TypeScript**, **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This project emphasizes clean code practices, proper version control, and team collaboration.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **TypeScript**: Primary programming language for type safety and modern JavaScript features
- **Client-Side Only**: No backend required - all functionality runs in the browser
- **Local Storage**: Use browser storage for data persistence

### Architecture & Design
- **MVC Pattern**: Implement clear separation between Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic)
- **OOP Principles**: Use classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism where appropriate
- **Design Methodology**: 
  - Apply **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** naming convention for CSS
  - Create flowcharts to plan application logic
  - Define clear interfaces between components

### Development Workflow
- **Repository**: Create a new GitHub repository and share the link with your instructor
- **Version Control**: Use Git branches effectively (feature branches, proper merge practices)
- **Team Collaboration**: Ensure equal contribution from all team members with clear branch ownership

## Project Levels & Scoring

### Level 1 - E-Commerce Store (90 points)
**Difficulty**: Light

**Features**:
- Product catalog display (hardcoded or JSON data)  
- User shopping cart functionality
- Admin interface for product management (add/edit/delete products)
- Data persistence using localStorage
- Product filtering and search
- Responsive design

### Level 2 - Interactive Game (95 points)
**Difficulty**: Medium

**Features**:
- Simple browser-based game (e.g., puzzle, memory game, platformer)
- Smooth animations using CSS or Canvas
- User interaction handling (keyboard/mouse)
- Game state management
- Score tracking with localStorage
- Multiple difficulty levels

### Level 3 - Advanced Game (100 points)
**Difficulty**: Hard

**Features**:
- 2D or 3D game environment (Canvas/WebGL)
- Complex animations and visual effects
- Advanced scoring system with leaderboards
- Multiple game levels or stages
- Sound effects and music integration
- Collision detection and game physics
- Save/load game progress

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Excellence (40%)
- **Clean TypeScript Code**: Proper typing, interfaces, and modern TypeScript features
- **BEM Implementation**: Proper CSS organization using BEM methodology
- **MVC Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns and proper implementation
- **OOP Principles**: Effective use of classes and inheritance

### Team Collaboration (30%)
- **Equal Distribution**: All team members contribute meaningfully to the project
- **Branch Management**: Effective use of Git branches and proper merge practices
- **Code Reviews**: Evidence of collaborative code review process

### User Experience (30%)
- **Application Aesthetics**: Visually appealing and professional design
- **Functionality**: All features work as intended without bugs
- **Responsiveness**: Application works well across different devices and screen sizes

## Deliverables
1. **GitHub Repository**: Public repository with complete project code
2. **Documentation**: README file with setup instructions and project description
3. **Live Demo**: Deployed application (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar)
4. **Flowchart**: Visual representation of application logic and user flow
5. **TypeScript Configuration**: Proper tsconfig.json and build setup

## Technical Setup Requirements
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Configure proper TypeScript compilation
- **Module System**: Use ES6 modules for code organization
- **Build Process**: Set up a simple build process (can be as simple as tsc compilation)
- **Type Definitions**: Create proper interfaces and types for your data structures

## Submission Guidelines
- Share your GitHub repository link with the instructor before the deadline
- Ensure all team members are listed as contributors
- Include a brief presentation explaining your chosen level and implementation approach
- Provide clear instructions for running the TypeScript compilation and viewing the application
