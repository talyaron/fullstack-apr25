In our country, it is custom that old people are given priority in queues. Old people are those who are 75 years or older.

take several people with their age (Udi = 78, Shani = 25, etc.) and check with if statement if they are old or not. If they are old, print "you can move to the front of the queue", otherwise print "you have to wait in line".
