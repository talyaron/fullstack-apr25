  <h2>A Brief History</h2>

  <p>
    Muay Thai originated in Thailand centuries ago as a battlefield combat system called Muay Boran. Over time, it evolved into a sport and cultural tradition deeply woven into Thai identity. Fighters are still honored like warriors — entering the ring with the Wai Kru Ram Muay, a ritual dance showing respect to their teachers and ancestors.<br><br>
    Today, Muay Thai is practiced globally, not only as a combat sport but also as a path to discipline, fitness, and inner strength.
