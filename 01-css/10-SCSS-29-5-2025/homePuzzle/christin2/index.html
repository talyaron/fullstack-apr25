                <h3>Welcome to My Portfolio</h3>
                <p>Hi everyone! I thought it would be nice to share a little bit about myself. My name is Christin Jeries, and I have a deep connection to the beautiful land, having been born and raised in the charming village of Jish in the northern part of the country. I came into the world in 1993, and my upbringing in this close-knit community has shaped who I am today.</p>

                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Family is at the heart of who I am. Growing up in a lively household with three incredible sisters and a brother shaped my world. Now, I'm a proud aunt to four wonderful nieces, and yes, it's definitely a girl-dominated family ‚Äì and I wouldn't have it any other way! These cherished connections with family and friends are a constant source of joy, grounding me even as I explore new horizons.</p>
                <p>My professional journey is built on a passion for understanding both the human mind and the logic of data. I pursued a Bachelor's in Psychology, gaining fascinating insights into human behavior. This intellectual curiosity then led me to a Master's in Statistics, a powerful combination that has proven invaluable in my career. Currently, I apply these analytical skills and my keen attention to detail as a Quality Engineer in the medical industry, a challenging and rewarding role where I ensure the highest standards for products that impact well-being.</p>
                <p>Beyond work and family, I'm genuinely driven by a thirst for learning. Whether it's diving into a new subject, mastering a new skill, or simply expanding my global knowledge, I find immense fulfillment in the process. This curiosity naturally fuels my love for travel. Venturing to new places, immersing myself in diverse cultures, and experiencing life through different lenses is truly special. And, of course, no trip is complete without savoring the local cuisine ‚Äì exploring new flavors is always a highlight!</p>
