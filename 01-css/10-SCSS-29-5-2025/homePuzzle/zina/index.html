                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>My name is Zina Biton, and I am a strong and 
                    inspiring woman.Half Israeli and half Bedouin, 
                    I grew up in a Moroccan home with nine siblings,surrounded by 
                    love and warmth. My life journey began at the age of 17when I received
                     my first gift from God—my eldest daughter. 
                     From that moment,I knew my life would be dedicated to her. 
                     Eight years later,another unexpected surprise arrived—three more gifts
                      I had not been prepared for,yet they became the driving force of my life.
                      Today, at 35, I am proud to present myself as a successful woman,
                      one who overcomes challenges and leads her life with strength,
                    faith and success</p>

                <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                <p>In my free time, I find joy in the little things that make life beautiful.
                    I love getting lost in a good book, 
                    where every page opens a new world and inspires my imagination.
                    I enjoy creating delicious dishes that reflect the rich flavors of 
                    my Moroccan and Bedouin heritage.Long </p>
