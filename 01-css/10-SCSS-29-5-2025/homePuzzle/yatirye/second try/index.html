               Neama
               Liri
               and Yahav
               A little more information about myself: I have been living in Yeruham for 10 years, but I was born and raised in a moshav in the northern Negev called "Bitha."</p>

               And in this section I will tell you a little about my family.

            <h2>My History</h2>
            <p>I was born 35 years ago in Moshav Bitha and lived there until I was 25.
               I joined the army in 2007 and served in the Intelligence Corps. After 3 years, I finished my duty and became a citizen for a period of 4 years, at the end of which I returned to military service for 7 years in the Intelligence Corps until 2022.
               In 2022, I started working for a company called “Raval” and I am responsible for exporting its goods abroad, mainly to the US, Luxembourg and China</p>

            <h2>My Present</h2>
            <p>I currently work for a company called "Raval" and responsible for exporting its goods abroad. In addition, I have been serving in the reserves since October 7th, each time for a period of several months. 
               And for this time, it,s the third round.</p>

        <section id="future" class="future">
            <h2>My Future</h2>
            <p>The truth is that this is a difficult question that I ask myself and avoid a lot. 
               In a world where it is difficult to know what will happen tomorrow, making a guess about the future is not trivial.
               So I will just look at it differently. 
               What do I wish for myself in the future - I wish myself a bright future to do what I love and love what I do</p>
