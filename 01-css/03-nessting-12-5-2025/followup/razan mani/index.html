        <p>Stitch, also known as Experiment 626 (pronounced "six two six"), is a fictional character from Disney's Lilo & Stitch franchise. A genetically engineered, extraterrestrial life-form resembling a blue koala, he is the more prominent of the franchise's two title protagonists, the other being his human adopter and best friend Lilo Pelekai.

            Stitch was created by Lilo & Stitch co-writer and co-director Chris Sanders,[2] who also voices him in almost all media that he appears in, primarily in Western-produced works. Ben Diskin voices the character in the English versions of the Asian-produced television spin-offs Stitch! and Stitch & Ai.</p>
