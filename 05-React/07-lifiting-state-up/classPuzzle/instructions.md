Here's a clearer version:

Create an ice cream shop app with the following features:

Main component — Displays a list of available ice creams, showing each item's image, name, and price.
Form component — Allows users to add new ice cream items to the list.
State management — Use the "lifting state up" pattern to pass data from the form component to the main app, keeping the ice cream list in sync.
