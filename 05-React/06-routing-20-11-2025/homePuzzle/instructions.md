generate an app that gets random dog images, by breed, from the Dog CEO API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

use this documentation for reference: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/breed

us React Router to create the following routes in your app:
"breads/:breedName" - displays a random image of the specified breed

example: /breeds/labrador should show a random image of a labrador.

the app should have a navigation menu with links to at least three different breeds (e.g., "labrador", "pug", "dalmatian"). When a user clicks on a link, they should be taken to the corresponding route and see a random image of that breed.
